title: Hyyek

( Rough Draft )

Hyyek is a hard fork of Bitcoin Core. It allows users to spend to [Drivechain](http://www.drivechain.info/) scripts.

Unlike previous hard forks:

1. It does NOT compete on: development; usage; being listed on an exchange; or the "Bitcoin" name.
2. It doesn't actually change *any* consensus rules. It just resets the difficulty one time (in order to force a second network to appear). On *that* new network, Drivechain immediately activates as a soft fork.
3. It will be announced well in advance.



## FAQ

### 1. How many developers do you have? ### {#devs}

This project is not competing on development.

The non-Drivechain parts of the codebase will always be identical to Bitcoin Core. When/if future inventions are merged into Core (such as: sighash-noinput, Confidential Transactions, etc.), we will just click the merge button ourselves.

So, all Bitcoin Core developers are working on this project, whether they want to or not.

### 2. How many people, do you think, will use this software? ### {#users}

The project isn't competing on users, either.

The replay protection is [user-controlled opt-in](http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/garp/). So it is off by default which means that, if no one does anything, every single transaction in the next Bitcoin Core block, will be immediately replayed into the Hyyek mempool and end up in the next Hyyek block.

So, all BTC users are transacting on this blockchain, whether they want to or not.

### 3. How many exchanges do you think will list the coin? ### {#exchanges}

This project is not competing on "getting listed", either. If exchanges do not list the coin, you can simply replay attack them and acquire the coin for free.

So they will probably be forced to list the coin, whether they like it or not.

### 4. If Hyyek succeeds, then Drivechain's value will have been demonstrated to the public. But surely, at that point, BTC would soft fork to add Drivechain (or a Drivechain-like technology). And this would probably kill Hyyek (since Hyyek can't compete with BTC's network effects). So, how can this project have any upside?

I have [taken steps](http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/imex/) to protect the upside of the project.

For example, I try to arrange for BTC mining to cease, at the exact moment that Hyyek succeeds. This is encouraged via: identical PoW-algos; a lower Hyyek difficulty; and the fact that financial losses are only experienced by those BTC-users who split their coins and intentionally bet *against* Drivechain.

In general, Drivechain's security assumptions require Core to add it via a MASF (miner-activated soft fork). But if BTC miners believed in Drivechain, they could instead just switch to mining Hyyek.


### 5. If you want to leave BTC, then why not "build on top of" BCH (or BSV)?

BCH had a [clumsy launch](http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/garp/#ii-bitcoin-cash), and has [fewer users](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactions-btc-bch.html#1y), a lower marketcap, and less R&D. Its codebase has undergone frivolous modification, pointlessly imperiling BCH's ability to take advantage of future BTC innovation. These five undesirable qualities act to repel people who are, respectfully: strategic, sociable, sophisticated, technically-minded, and prudent.

The strategy of "hard forking to please some users at the expense of others" is anti-cooperative, and ultimately unsustainable.

BSV has all of these problems, only worse.

### 6. How do you plan to succeed without partnering with Blockstream / Bitcoin.com / an eccentric Australian?

If the project is good, the right partners will find *it*.

### 5. Are Hard Forks Evil?

Opinions on them differ. [I've argued](http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/against-the-hard-fork/) that they set a horrible precendent. [Others](https://twitter.com/spencernoon/status/933135469520531456) have [different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-ms68Ircus) views.
