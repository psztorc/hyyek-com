Rough Draft

Hyyek is my contingency plan, if Drivechain fails to activate on Bitcoin Core.

It is different from other hard forks in that:

1. It does NOT compete on: development; usage; being listed on an exchange; or the "Bitcoin" name.
2. It doesn't actually change *any* consensus rules. It just resets the difficulty one time (in order to force a second network to appear).
3. It will be announced well in advance.
4. It has been *designed to compete* (see [GARP](http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/garp/) and [IMEX](http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/imex/)).

## FAQ

### How many developers do you have? ### {#devs}

This project is not competing on development.

The non-Drivechain parts of the codebase will always be identical to Bitcoin Core. When/if future inventions are merged into Core (such as: sighash-noinput, Confidential Transactions, etc.), we will just click the merge button ourselves.

So, to answer the question, myself + CryptAxe + a few people , PLUS all of the Bitcoin Core developers.

The project isn't competing on development, it is just competing on one decision: whether or not to grant users access to merged-mined P2P sidechains.

### How many people, do you think, will use this software? ### {#users}

The project isn't competing on users, either.

The replay protection is user-controlled opt-in. So it is off by default which means that, if no one does anything, every single transaction in the next Bitcoin Core block, will be immediately replayed into the Hyyek mempool and end up in the next Hyyek block.

### How many exchanges do you think will list the coin? ### {#exchanges}

This project is not competing on "getting listed", either. If exchanges do not list the coin, you can simply replay attack them and acquire the coin for free.

So they will probably be forced to list the coin, whether they like it or not.
