Rough Draft

Hyyek is my contingency plan, if Drivechain fails to activate on Bitcoin Core.

### How is this different from previous Bitcoin hard forks?

1. The hard fork is NOT competing on: development; usage; being listed on an exchange; or the "Bitcoin" name.
2. This HF doesn't actually change *any* rules, at all. It just resets the difficulty once, to force a second network to appear.
3. It will be announced well in advance, allowing plenty of time for research.
4. It has been *designed to compete* (see [GARP](http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/garp/) and [IMEX](http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/imex/)).


### How many developers do you have? ### {#devs}

This project is not competing on development. The non-Drivechain codebase will be identical to Bitcoin Core. It will be identical when it launches, and at all points in the future. So this project should be indistinguishable from Bitcoin Core in every respect. Including all future Core inventions such as: sighash-noinput, Confidential Transactions, etc. As soon as these are merged into Core, we will just click the merge button ourselves.

So, to answer the question, myself + CryptAxe + a few people , PLUS all of the Bitcoin Core developers.

The project isn't competing on development, it is just competing on one decision: whether or not to grant users access to merged-mined P2P sidechains.

### How many people, do you think, will use this software? ### {#users}

The project isn't competing on users, either.

The replay protection is user-controlled opt-in. So it is off by default which means that, if no one does anything, every single transaction in the next Bitcoin Core block, will be immediately replayed into the Hyyek mempool and end up in the next Hyyek block.

### How many exchanges do you think will list the coin? ### {#exchanges}

This project is not competing on "getting listed", either. If exchanges do not list the coin, you can simply replay attack them and acquire the coin for free.

So they will probably be forced to list the coin, whether they like it or not.
